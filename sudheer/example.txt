hi there this is my new class for git & git hub so it is used for example1.txt for the new sending options for the working directory.
After a long time i am using the github for reverse the practice we are doing it in an different way with a perfect dedication for thelearning sections
resource "github_repository" "example" {
  name        = "my-awesome-repo"
  description = "This is my GitHub repository"
  visibility  = "private"
  auto_init   = true
}
jenkins pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        // Add more stages as needed
    }
}
If we need to check out a specific branch and use credentials (e.g., SSH key or username/password), we can customize the git step:
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        GIT_CREDENTIALS = credentials('your-git-credentials-id')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'feature/my-feature-branch', credentialsId: env.GIT_CREDENTIALS, url: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        // Add more stages as needed
    }
}
If we want to disable changelog generation during checkout, use the checkout step:
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: 'feature/my-feature-branch']], doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false, extensions: [[$class: 'DisableChangelog']], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git']]])
            }
        }
        // Add more stages as needed
    }
}
